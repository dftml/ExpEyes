# ExpEyes
Designed Experiment
Our primary goal in this project was to build physics experiments using the expeyes-17 software packages and carry them out using python code. 
Aim 1: To demonstrate Electromagnetic Induction.
Aim 2: To find natural frequency of coupled pendulum in different modes.
Aim 3: To study variation in voltage with intensity of the given solar panel.
Aim 4: To demonstrate and design a weighing machine.
Aim 5: To determine the time period of variable mass pendulum with variable m.
Aim 6: To make photogate with expeyes.
