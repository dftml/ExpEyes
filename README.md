# ExpEyes
Designed Experiment <br><br>
Our primary goal in this project was to build physics experiments using the expeyes-17 software packages and carry them out using python code. <br>
Aim 1: To demonstrate Electromagnetic Induction. <br>
Aim 2: To find natural frequency of coupled pendulum in different modes. <br>
Aim 3: To study variation in voltage with intensity of the given solar panel. <br>
Aim 4: To demonstrate and design a weighing machine. <br>
Aim 5: To determine the time period of variable mass pendulum with variable m. <br>
Aim 6: To make photogate with expeyes. <br><br><br>
