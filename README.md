# ExpEyes
Designed Experiment
Our primary goal in this project was to build physics experiments using the expeyes-17 software packages and carry them out using python code. 
Aim: To demonstrate Electromagnetic Induction.
Aim: To find natural frequency of coupled pendulum in different modes.
Aim: To study variation in voltage with intensity of the given solar panel.
Aim: To demonstrate and design a weighing machine.
Aim: To determine the time period of variable mass pendulum with variable m.
Aim: To make photogate with expeyes.
